        "abstract": "Metal foils, wires, and seamless tubes with increased mechanical strength are provided. As opposed to wrought materials that are made of a single metal or alloy, these materials are made of two or more layers forming a laminate structure. Laminate structures are known to increase mechanical strength of sheet materials such as wood and paper products and are used in the area of thin films to increase film hardness, as well as toughness. Laminate metal foils have not been used or developed because the standard metal forming technologies, such as rolling and extrusion, for example, do not lend themselves to the production of laminate structures. Vacuum deposition technologies can be developed to yield laminate metal structures with improved mechanical properties. In addition, laminate structures can be designed to provide special qualities by including layers that have special properties such as superelasticity, shape memory, radio-opacity, corrosion resistance etc. Examples of articles which may be made by the inventive laminate structures include implantable medical devices that are fabricated from the laminated deposited films and which present a blood or body fluid and tissue contact surface that has controlled heterogeneities in material constitution. An endoluminal stent-graft and web-stent that is made of a laminated film material deposited and etched into regions of structural members and web regions subtending interstitial regions between the structural members. An endoluminal graft is also provided which is made of a biocompatible metal or metal-like material. The endoluminal stent-graft is characterized by having controlled heterogeneities in the stent material along the blood flow surface of the stent and the method of fabricating the stent using vacuum deposition methods."

        "abstract": "Described techniques and apparatuses relate to determining an attenuation environment surrounding a satellite terminal in a satellite communication system. The satellite terminal may receive signals from an auxiliary satellite system, and determine aspects of an attenuation environment that may affect communications with a communications satellite system. For example, transmissions from an auxiliary satellite system may be associated with a respective location of the transmitting satellite in order to define an attenuation profile for the satellite terminal antenna assembly. Subsequent signals from the auxiliary satellite system may be compared with the attenuation map, and the comparison may be used to identify a diagnostic condition for communications with a communications satellite system. In some examples the comparison of signals to the attenuation profile may indicate an obstruction between the satellite terminal antennas and a communications satellite, or a misalignment of a satellite terminal antenna assembly."

        "abstract": "Various of the disclosed embodiments concern systems and methods for tracking virality and social lift of media content. In some embodiments, an analytics engine creates and tags URLs to media content using generation codes, time codes, or both. The codes and their respective values allow the analytics engine to determine whether trends or patterns exist in how media content is viewed and shared. The generation codes and time codes can be used instead of, or in addition to, conventional UTM codes. The generation code, time code, or both, can be used to determine which segments (e.g., generations, time periods) of viewers generate a profit, subsequent viewers, etc. For example, the analytics engine can determine when an advertising campaign for a piece of media content should be terminated, rather than simply indicating whether the campaign should continue."
